	and global interrupts are enabled. If SS is an input and is driven low when the SPI is in Master mode, this
	will also set the SPIF Flag. SPIF is cleared by hardware when executing the corresponding interrupt
	handling vector. Alternatively, the SPIF bit is cleared by first reading the SPI Status Register with SPIF
	set, then accessing the SPI Data Register (SPDR).
